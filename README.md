========================

An unfinished collection of typings.

I exported a dump of the d.ts files and I'm trying to update them, removing all the uses of `any` as I use the functions and learn more about how they are used.

Also, using as a learning project to get some typings into DefinitelyTyped, which I am in huge admiration of.
